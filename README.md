# Vietnam_War_Campaign_Data_Analysis_Spark_SQL

This project explores the extensive bombing campaigns during the Vietnam War. Utilizing Apache Spark, Spark Dataframe API, and Spark SQL, the analysis delves into various aspects of the military efforts based on historical datasets.

Languages and Frameworks: Apache Spark, Spark Dataframe API, Spark SQL

Analyzed Data:
- Mission Count by Country: Total number of missions for each country involved, identified by CountryFlyingMission.
- Mission Distribution Over Time: Analysis of the daily mission count per country and identification of peak activity periods.
- Specific Mission Analysis: Detailed examination of missions on significant dates, such as the number of takeoffs on June 29, 1966, aimed at North Vietnam.
- Campaign Analysis: Identification of months with the highest number of missions and campaigns that saw the heaviest bombings.
- Aircraft Analysis: Determination of the most frequently used aircraft type based on the number of missions.


Visualizations:
- Bar Chart of Missions by Country: Illustrates the contribution of each country to the bombing efforts.
- Daily Missions Timeline: Visual timeline depicting the number of missions conducted each day by all participating countries.
  
Techniques and Tools Used:
- Data Loading and Transformation: Utilized Spark Dataframes for efficient data manipulation and querying.
- SQL Queries: Leveraged Spark SQL for precise data retrieval and aggregation essential for answering the research questions.
- Visualization: Employed Python visualization libraries compatible with Spark to represent data graphically for better insights.
